# SimphonyPOSDubaiRestaurants
A Dubai based biggest Restaurant/Hotel Chain with Oracle Simphony POS installed within their building has implemented to solution to 
place the order from one of the app using SOAP API exposed by Oracle Simphony Machine, it has all the actual implementation with a virtual
test environment hosted within thier premise, using this one can place the order with any custom requirements and hack is that you can place an 
order with your own defined amount, say for example one pizza is costing you 20 AED, using this application you can make an API call and place the order
at 1 AED as well, no matter what amount you put you can place that order which will be beneficial for the user, to place the order in order for theier benefit
and enjoy the scrumptious meal at there own cost. 


A big warning for the Restaurants/Hotels vendors(Rather individual sales person) that do not work with these local vendors rather sales person 
who has no any technical knowledge, which may further leadto financial losses for the restaurant and hotels and can be exploited by the users, i have
kept it here deliberately for the restaurant and hotels to understand the severity.
